TODO
Future[T] is a container for a value of type T
 that will be available later (asynchronously) — it may succeed or fail.
 Future and Promise are constructs used
 for synchronizing program execution
 in some concurrent programming languages.
 They describe an object that acts as a proxy for a result that is initially unknown,
 usually because the computation of its value is yet incomplete.

 Futures provide a way to reason about performing many operations
 in parallel– in an efficient and non-blocking way

 The properties of Future:
TODO
 Eagerly evaluated (strict and not lazy), meaning that when the caller of a function
 receives a Future reference,
 whatever asynchronous process that should complete it has probably started already.
 Memoized (cached), since being eagerly evaluated means that it behaves
 like a normal value instead of a function
 and the final result needs to be available to all listeners.
 The purpose of the value property is to return that memoized result or None
 if it isn’t complete yet.
 Goes without saying that calling its def value yields a non-deterministic result.
