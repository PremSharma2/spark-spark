/**
 * TODO
 * A companion object is an object with the same name as a class or trait and is defined
 * in the same source file as the associated file
 * or trait.
 * A companion object differs from other objects as
 * it has access rights to the class/trait that other objects do not.
 * In particular it can access methods
 * and fields that are private in the class/trait even private Constructor.
 *
 *
 * TODO
 * An analog to a companion object in Java is having a class with static methods.
 * In Scala you would move the static methods to a Companion object.
 *
 * One of the most common uses of a companion object is to define factory methods for class.
 * An example is case-classes. When a case-class is declared a companion object is created for the case-class with a factory
 * method that has the same signature as the primary constructor of the case class.
 * That is why one can create a case-class like: MyCaseClass(param1,â€ƒparam2). No new element is required for case-class instantiation.
 *
 * A second common use-case for companion objects is to create extractors for the class.
 * I will mention extractors in a future topic. Basically extractors allow matching to work with arbitrary classes.
 *
 * NOTE: Because the companion object and the class must be defined in the same source file and in same scope
 * you cannot create them in the interpreter.
 * So copy the following example into a file and run it in script mode
 *
