TODO
  Designing an API using the composing function paradigm in Scala can be a powerful approach
  to build a flexible and modular system. In this paradigm, you create small,
  focused functions that can be easily combined to create more complex behavior.
  To demonstrate this, let's consider a real-time use case for a stock trading platform.
TODO
  Real-Time Stock Trading API Use Case:
    Suppose you want to design an API for a real-time stock trading platform.
    The API should handle various functionalities like checking stock prices,
     placing orders, and managing user portfolios. We will focus on three main functionalities:
TODO
    1. Fetching stock prices
      2. Placing orders
  3. Managing user portfolios
TODO
  Step 1: Define the API endpoints:
  Start by defining the API endpoints as functions with relevant input and output types.
  For simplicity, we will use `String` for stock symbols, `Double` for stock prices,
  and `Boolean` to represent success/failure of actions.


 */

  // Fetch stock price function
  type FetchStockPrice = String => Option[Double]

  // Place order function
  type PlaceOrder = (String, Int) => Boolean

  // Manage user portfolio function
  type ManagePortfolio = (String, Int) => Boolean


  //Step 2: Implement the composing functions:
  //Next, implement the composing functions that will
  // combine the above basic functions to achieve complex behavior.
  // We'll use functional composition to combine the functionalities.


  // Composing function for fetching stock price and placing order
  def fetchStockAndPlaceOrder(fetchStockPrice: FetchStockPrice, placeOrder: PlaceOrder): String => Boolean =
    symbol => {
      fetchStockPrice(symbol) match {
        case Some(price) => placeOrder(symbol, price.toInt)
        case None => false
      }
    }

  // Composing function for fetching stock price and managing user portfolio
  def fetchStockAndManagePortfolio(fetchStockPrice: FetchStockPrice, managePortfolio: ManagePortfolio): String => Boolean =
    symbol => {
      fetchStockPrice(symbol) match {
        case Some(price) => managePortfolio(symbol, price.toInt)
        case None => false
      }
    }


 // Step 3: Implement the individual functions:
 // Now, you can implement the individual functions for fetching stock prices, placing orders,
  // and managing user portfolios. These functions could be backed
  // by external services or databases in a real system, but for this example,
  // we'll use simple mock functions.


  // Mock function for fetching stock prices
  def mockFetchStockPrice(symbol: String): Option[Double] = {
    // In a real system, this function would fetch the stock price from an external service
    // For simplicity, we'll use a mock data source
    val mockStockPrices = Map("AAPL" -> 150.0, "GOOGL" -> 2700.0, "AMZN" -> 3300.0)
    mockStockPrices.get(symbol)
  }

  // Mock function for placing orders
  def mockPlaceOrder(symbol: String, quantity: Int): Boolean = {
    // In a real system, this function would place the order through a trading platform
    // For simplicity, we'll just print the order details
    println(s"Placed order for $quantity shares of $symbol")
    true
  }

  // Mock function for managing user portfolios
  def mockManagePortfolio(symbol: String, quantity: Int): Boolean = {
    // In a real system, this function would update the user's portfolio with the given stock and quantity
    // For simplicity, we'll just print the action
    println(s"Managed user portfolio: Bought/Sold $quantity shares of $symbol")
    true
  }


  //Step 4: Combine the functions and expose the API:
  //Finally, combine the functions using the composing functions and expose the API to the external world.


  // Combined API for placing an order for a stock
  val placeOrderAPI: String => Boolean = fetchStockAndPlaceOrder(mockFetchStockPrice, mockPlaceOrder)

  // Combined API for managing user portfolio with a stock
  val managePortfolioAPI: String => Boolean = fetchStockAndManagePortfolio(mockFetchStockPrice, mockManagePortfolio)


//  Now you have an API that allows you to place orders and manage
  //  user portfolios in a real-time stock trading platform,
  //  using the composing function paradigm in Scala. By creating small,
  //  focused functions and combining them with composing functions,
  //  you build a modular and flexible system that can be easily extended and maintained.
