  // 1:  def receive(future : Future[P2PResponse]): Int
     this is not compiling because of the  type erasure
     what happens here is that type of Generics is removed at run time
     so it will look same  as this one
     def receive(future : Future[P2PRequest]): Int
     def receive(future : Future[P2PResponse]): Int
    get erased to the same JVM signature due to type erasure:
    def receive(Future): Int
    The JVM does not know the difference between
    Future[P2PRequest] and Future[P2PResponse] at runtime â€” they're both just Future
    This is why the compiler says it's "already defined".
