  /**
   * TODO
   * Welcome back. We were discussing Scala control structures.
   * The last item among the control abstraction is the for expression.
   * The Scala's for loop is a swiss army knife of iterations.
   * Here is the general structure of the for expression.
   *
   * // for ( seq ) yield { expr }
   *
   * TODO
   * It looks simple, but I realized that it is quite confusing to explain the above structure.
   * Let me take a progressive approach to explain that. To simplify the structure,
   * let's ignore the yield for now. The yield is optional.
   * You will be using it most of the time, but let's keep it aside for the moment.
   * Now the structure looks like this.
   *
   * for ( seq ) { expr }
   *
   *
   *
   *
   * TODO
   * Let's try to understand this structure.If you learned other languages,
   * the above structure should look familiar.
   * The things inside the parenthesis will control the number of iterations,
   * and those curly braces represent the body of the loop.
   * That's how it is in most of the languages.
   *
   * TODO
   * for (i <- 1 to 10) {
   * statement - 1;
   * statement - 2;
   * }
   *
   * TODO
   * You can have one or more expressions within the body.
   * If you have a single expression, curly braces are optional.
   * We don't have any complexity for the body of the loop.
   * It is almost same as any other language.
   * But the seq is somewhat complicated. It keeps confusing a lot of people.
   *
   * TODO
   * The sequence generator in Scala for loop
   * Letâ€™s start with the simplest form of the seq and then expand it step by step.
   * The simplest form of seq is a generator that looks something like below.
   *
   * e <- collection
   *
   * The collection is a Scala collection,
   * and e is a value that binds to each element of the collection.
   * Let's take an example.
   *
   * val seq = 1 to 5
   * // seq is a Range collection with ten elements.
   * //Now I can iterate through this collection using a for Loop.
   * for (i <- seq) println(i)
   * // You can remove the middleman and get a collection on the fly.
   * for (i <- 1 to 5) println(i)
   */

  /*
  TODO
     Internal mechanics for the scala for loop
    The Scala for loop is just a syntactic sugar for Higher Order Control Abstractions.
    Internally, both are same. What does it mean?
    That means the Scala compiler will convert the for loop to a combination of following control abstractions.
  todo
    foreach
   map
   flatMap
   withFilter : ITS FOR  lazy

TODO
     In other words, Scala doesn't have a for loop.
    It's just a syntactic sugar for a set of these methods. So,
   if you don't like the for loop,
 you can manage to code in Scala without even worrying about the for loops.
 The real purpose of the Scala for expression is to write the code in a way that makes more sense.
  You should use the for expression when you think your code is getting
  too cryptic using these methods and it would make more sense if you implement it using a for expression.
TODO
 The Yield in Scala for expression
 Now let's bring the yield back into the structure.
TODO
 for ( seq ) yield { expr }
 in the absence of yield for comprehension behaves like forEach control abstraction
 because forEach returns the unit where as when yield comes it becomes like
 we applying map function after each iteration
 IT WILL be liek seq.flatmap(s => _.map) or seq.map(f)

  /*
TODO
     Initialization:
     Use Array.fill to create an array with 12 zeroes.
     This array represents the total for each month
     and avoids the need for repeatedly filtering and mapping the data.

 TODO
     Single Traversal:
     The function traverses the snapshots sequence once,
      using the foreach method to accumulate totals directly
      into the corresponding index of the monthlyTotals array.
      This avoids the inefficiency of repeatedly filtering the sequence for each month.

TODO
    Direct Index Access:
    By directly accessing the array index that corresponds
    to each month,
    the function efficiently aggregates totals
     without unnecessary transformations or intermediate collections.
TODO
    Performance:
    The revised approach is more efficient in terms of both time (O(n)
     where n is the number of snapshots) and space (using a fixed-size array),
     compared to the original approach that iteratively filters the list for each month.
