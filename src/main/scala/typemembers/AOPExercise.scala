/**
TODO
   Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is often used to
   handle cross-cutting concerns like logging, security, and transactions,
   separate from the main business logic.
   In Scala, you can approximate AOP features using design patterns like the cake pattern.
TODO
 The cake pattern is a way to structure your Scala application
 to allow for dependency injection and modularization.
 It uses traits as modules and relies on self-types for assembling these modules.

TODO
   Examples
   Here's an example illustrating the cake pattern
   with AOP-like behavior,
   focusing on logging and authentication as cross-cutting concerns.

TODO
 Cross-Cutting Concerns:
 Logging: Recording relevant information about the operation.
 Authentication: Ensuring that the user is authenticated before proceeding with the operation.





TODO
 Point-Cuts:
 Point-cuts in this example are the locations
 where the cross-cutting logic gets applied,
 i.e., before the execution of the query method in DatabaseComponent.
TODO
 LoggedDatabaseComponent:
 This trait extends DatabaseComponent and
 also has a self-type of LoggerComponent.
 It overrides the query method to add logging,
 making this the point-cut for logging.

TODO
 AuthenticatedDatabaseComponent:
 Similarly, this trait extends DatabaseComponent and
 has a self-type of AuthenticatorComponent.
 It overrides the query method to add authentication checks,
 making this the point-cut for authentication.

TODO
 Explanation:
 DatabaseComponent:
 The primary business logic for querying a database.

TODO
 LoggerComponent:
 Handles the logging aspect.
TODO
 AuthenticatorComponent:
 Handles the authentication aspect.

TODO
 LoggedDatabaseComponent:
 Wraps around DatabaseComponent to add logging features.
 i.e cross cutting concern applied to the query method

TODO
 AuthenticatedDatabaseComponent:
 Wraps around DatabaseComponent to add authentication features.

TODO
 Application:
 This is the final application object that mixes in
 all the traits to form the complete application,
 often called "assembling the cake."
TODO
 By using the cake pattern in this way,
 we've modularized the cross-cutting concerns of logging and authentication.
 They can be easily mixed into other components as needed,
 thus achieving separation of concerns and maintainability.
