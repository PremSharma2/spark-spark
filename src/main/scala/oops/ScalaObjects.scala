TODO
  UTILITY CLASSES
  Depending on your needs,
  creating a private class constructor may not be necessary at all.
 For instance, in Java youâ€™d create a file utilities class by
  defining static methods in a Java class,
 but in Scala you do the same thing by putting all the methods in a Scala object:


 */
object FileUtils {

  def readFile(filename: String) = {
    // code here ...
  }

  def writeToFile(filename: String, contents: String) {
    // code here ...
  }
}
}
