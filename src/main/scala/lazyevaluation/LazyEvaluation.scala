TODO
 Side  effect if it modifies a mutable data structure or variable, uses IO,
  throws an exception or halts an error;
   all of these things are considered side effects.
  The reason why side effects are bad is because, if you had them,
  a function can be unpredictable depending on the state of the system;
  when a function has no side effects we can execute it anytime,
  it will always return the same result, given the same input.

  TODO
       The easiest way is probably f.map(identity), which doesn't necessarily return a List,
       but an appropriate type of sequence, based on the original sequence type before filtering.
       If you want strictly a List, convert the result to List afterwards: f.map(identity).toList.
       As for the difference, for most collections filter immediately performs the filtering,
        builds a new collection in memory and returns it,
        and withFilter returns an object,
        which stores the original collection and does the filtering only when an element is requested.
